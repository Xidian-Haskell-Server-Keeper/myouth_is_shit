# Code Climate

Today we will talk about a tool named Code Climate. Somebody might ask what Code Climate is, and my answer is "a suite of static analysis".

The first time when came across Code Climate is after I clicked *Integrations* on the GitHub. I try searching that on the Internet,
and finally find an answer: After using Code Climate, you will refactor your code every second. That is half a joke.
However such a tool will help you to improve code quality.

Of course, Code Climate is open source now. Meanwhile you can link your GitHub account to Code Climate, and analysis your project.
To analysis project, you need to write a YAML file named .codeclimate.yml and configure analysis system with this file. 
The detail can be found in Code Climate's official website.

And those are what I want to talk with you. And have a nice day.
