Docker is a kind of virtualization software, just like a virtual machine, but docker is "just like". Docker is an open-source project about automating the deployment of containers. And at the same time, the containers are not like VM's containers, because docker's containers are just included the application, which you want to host, and a clean environment. That is why docker is just like VM but is not VM, because docker is based on linux, and it just provides a clean layer of linux. Docker is an operating-system-level linux virtualization software. You can only execute the binary of linux on it. 

Docker has many advantages. The time of launching a docker container is shorter than VM, and even shorter than waking up the operation-system. You can also stop a container in a short time if needed it. If the number of you website's visiter is more than 1,000 in the morning, and less than 10 in evening. Docker might be a good choice -- launching 10 containers in the morning and only one in the evening.
